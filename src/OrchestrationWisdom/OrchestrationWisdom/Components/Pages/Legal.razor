        <h2>Provider Independence</h2>
        <p>
            Provider work facilitated through this platform is independent. Orchestration Wisdom
            acts as a facilitator and matching service, but does not employ providers or guarantee
            their work. Providers are verified based on capability tests and proof of outcomes,
            not payment.

            arrangements. Ranking is based on fit and proof, not payment. Any monetization
