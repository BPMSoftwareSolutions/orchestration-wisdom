        <h2>What We Do</h2>
        <p>
            Orchestration Wisdom exists to turn complex operational problems into clear,
            implementable patterns. We believe that most operational breakdowns aren't people
            problems—they're orchestration gaps. Missing ownership. Unclear SLAs. Broken handoffs.
            Invisible capacity constraints.
        </p>
        <p>
            This platform provides a structured library of operational patterns, backed by
            implementation-ready diagrams, checklists, and component breakdowns.

        <h2>Why We Built This</h2>
        <p>
            Too many companies reinvent the same operational solutions in isolation. Support
            ticket escalation backlogs. Knowledge loss during handoffs. Capacity planning failures.
            These aren't unique problems—they're recurring patterns with known orchestration shifts.
        </p>
        <p>
            We built this platform to create a shared knowledge base where operational excellence
            becomes composable, not heroic.

        <h2>Our Approach</h2>
        <p>
            Every pattern follows the Orchestration Wisdom System (OWS)—a methodology that combines:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Pattern-based problem framing</li>
            <li>Budget-constrained Mermaid diagrams (no-scroll clarity)</li>
            <li>High Quality Orchestration (HQO) rubric scoring</li>
            <li>Component decomposition for incremental implementation</li>
            <li>Exportable artifacts (ARTICLE.md, checklists)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Principles</h2>
        <p>
            We operate according to clear principles: <a href="/principles">clarity before conversion</a>,
            systems over blame, trust as the moat, and composable solutions. No dark patterns,
            no pay-to-win ranking, no content gates.
        </p>

        <h2>What's Next</h2>
        <p>
            This is the MVP—focused on pattern publication, clarity, and self-serve value.
            Future versions will introduce expert verification, capability matching, and
            solution composition. But first, we build trust through quality content.
