        <h1>Orchestration Principles</h1>
        <p>The core beliefs that guide how we build, share, and evolve operational patterns.</p>

    <section class="principle">
        <h2>1. Clarity before conversion</h2>
        <p>
            The platform exists to create clarity, not to maximize clicks or engagement metrics.
            No popups, no dark patterns, no noisy ads. If a pattern doesn't help someone understand
            their problem better, it shouldn't exist on this platform.
        </p>
        <p><strong>In practice:</strong> Articles deliver value immediately. No email gates, no forced sign-ups to access content.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="principle">
        <h2>2. One-screen diagrams</h2>
        <p>
            Diagrams should render without scrolling where possible. If a diagram requires scrolling
            to understand, it's probably too complex. Simplicity in visualization is a feature, not a limitation.
        </p>
        <p><strong>In practice:</strong> Mermaid diagrams follow strict budget constraints (≤7 actors, ≤18 steps).</p>
    </section>

    <section class="principle">
        <h2>3. Systems over blame</h2>
        <p>
            Operational problems are pattern problems, not people problems. We use illustrative,
            pattern-based language rather than company-specific internal claims. The goal is learning,
            not finger-pointing.
        </p>
        <p><strong>In practice:</strong> No "Company X failed because..." language. Instead: "This pattern emerges when..."</p>
    </section>

    <section class="principle">
        <h2>4. Composable solutions</h2>
        <p>
            Complex operational challenges decompose into discrete, implementable components.
            Solutions should be modular: companies can adopt pieces that fit their context without
            needing to implement everything at once.
        </p>
        <p><strong>In practice:</strong> Every pattern maps to specific components with clear prerequisites and outcomes.</p>

    <section class="principle">
        <h2>5. Trust is the moat</h2>
        <p>
            Ranking and matching cannot be pay-to-win. Provider recommendations are based on
            fit and proof, not payment. Verification fees exist, but they never influence ranking.
            Transparency is non-negotiable.
        </p>
        <p><strong>In practice:</strong> All monetization is disclosed. Ranking algorithms prioritize capability match and outcomes.</p>

    <section class="principle">
        <h2>6. Artifacts over meetings</h2>
        <p>
            Knowledge transfer happens through structured artifacts, not heroic individual effort.
            Operational playbooks, decision logs, and runbooks are first-class deliverables,
            not afterthoughts.
        </p>
        <p><strong>In practice:</strong> Patterns include exportable checklists, downloadable markdown, and reusable templates.</p>
